# Configuration file to specify what file paths users are allowed to
# access using what prefixes.
#
# Lines that begin with a hashmark (#) are comments and
# ignored.
#
# Root symbols should only contain capital letters, underscore,
# and digits; the first character cannot be a digit.
# The dollar sign is NOT part of the root symbol.
#
# The paths that they define should either be empty, or
# end in an at sign (@) or end in a slash (/).
# The quotation marks are not part of the path, but they
# should still be supplied.
#
# Examples: 
# LOCAL1="file:/home/user/old_kite_data/"
# LOCAL2="file:/home/user/old_kite_data2/
# S3N_OLD_DIR="s3n://key:pwd@old_kite_data/"
# S3N_OLD_DIR2="s3n://key:pwd@"
# EMPTY=""

# Note a specification of EMPTY such as the one above gives the user
# full access to anything; e.g., they can say
# $EMPTY$s3n://key:password@somedir/somefile or
# $EMTPY$file://etc/passwd
