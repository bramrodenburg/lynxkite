# Configuration file to specify what file paths users are allowed to
# access using what prefixes.
#
# Special prefixes can be defined here that expand to directories, paths, etc.
# Suppose, for example, that the administrator speficies 
# DIR="file:/home/user/kite/" in this file. Then whenever the user references
# DIR$subdir/data.txt (s)he will access the file:/home/users/kite/subdir/data.txt
# Moreover, there is no other way a user can refer to that file (unless there are
# other prefixes defined here that make this possible).

# Format:
# Lines that begin with a hashmark (#) are comments and ignored.
#
# Prefix symbols should only contain capital letters, underscore,
# and digits; the first character cannot be a digit.
# The dollar sign is NOT part of the prefix symbol.
#
# The paths that they define should either be empty, or
# end in an at sign (@) or end in a slash (/).
# The defined paths should always start with a file system specification (e.g. s3n: or file:) unless
# they are empty.
# The quotation marks are not part of the path, but they
# should still be supplied.
#
#
# Examples: 
# LOCAL1="file:/home/user/old_kite_data/"
# LOCAL2="file:/home/user/old_kite_data2/"
# S3N_OLD_DIR="s3n://key:pwd@old_kite_data/"
# S3N_OLD_DIR2="s3n://key:pwd@"
# EMPTY=""
#
# Note that a specification of EMPTY such as the one above gives the user
# full access to anything; e.g., they can say
# EMPTY$s3n://key:password@somedir/somefile or
# EMPTY$file://etc/passwd
