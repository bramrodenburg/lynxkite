## Installing the LynxKite binaries

The LynxKite archive contains the following:

*kite_<version_number>*: This directory contains the LynxKite binary and libraries.
*run-kite-<version_number>.sh*: This is a symlink for starting the program.
*spark-<version_number>*: This directory contains the version of Apache Spark used by LynxKite.

Simply uncompress the archive to a directory. Make sure to unpack the archive on the target
Linux platform. Unpacking on Windows then copying is known to cause problems.
