## Troubleshooting

### YARN memory limit

When trying to start LynxKite on YARN, you may hit the YARN per-application memory limit. LynxKite
will log an error message, such as:
```
Required executor memory (12288+384 MB) is above the max threshold (7003 MB) of this cluster!
```
See <<yarn-memory-limit>> for the fix.

### Disk runs out of space

This can be due to many reasons such as various logs, Spark shuffle files, the LynxKite data files
etc. See <<configure-directories>> for more details and fixes.
