## Recommendations

### Hardware

It is recommended to have at least 16 GB RAM per machine. It is optimal to have around 4 GB RAM per CPU core.
It is common to use 32 GB RAM machines with 8 CPU cores. LynxKite needs a lot of storage for cache data, so we
recommend to have a sufficiently large partition for that (or a distributed file system like HDFS). The needed
capacity varies heavily on the way LynxKite is used, but it's recommended to plan with at least 5x of the initial
data size. For Spark shuffle files it's recommended to use a smaller but faster drive (e.g. a partition on an
SSD with at least 100 GB).

### Software

LynxKite runs on any modern Linux distributions. We recommend using Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS or CentOS/Redhat 6.7,
because LynxKite has been tested on those systems.
