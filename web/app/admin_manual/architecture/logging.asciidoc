## Logging

LynxKite logs various activities. The logs are found in the `log` directory under the installation
directory of the application.

### The application log

The main log of LynxKite is the application log. LynxKite creates a new log file every day it when
it is used. It automatically deletes the log files older than 60 days.

The application logs the following activites (among other things):

- User login attempts, successful logins and logouts.
- All HTTP requests arrived to the web server including the user and the URL.
- Accesses of files in the `KITE_DATA_DIR`.

It is possible for admin users to access the most current version of these logs from a browser via
*<LynxKite_URL>/logs*.

### STDERR and STDOUR

Every time LynxKite is started a log is created for STDERR and STDOUT with the process ID of the
application. These logs generally do not contain many information unless something went wrong
during the startup process.
