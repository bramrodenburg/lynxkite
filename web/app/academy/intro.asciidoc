# Introduction

LynxKite from http://lynxanalytics.com/[Lynx Analytics] is a graph analytics platform. It can be
used through a browser-based interface or via the scripting API. Both interfaces are thoroughly
documented in the _LynxKite User Manual_ built into the LynxKite. Each part of the user interface
also displays the relevant documentation in popup boxes when hovering over the help icons
(+++<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i>+++).

All that reference documentation helps a great deal when you know what you are looking for and just
need some help finding it. But it helps you much less when you are just starting out with LynxKite.
What can this program do in the first place?

LynxKite Academy is a collection of objective-based lessons. The first lessons are specifically
targeted at first-time users, but the complexity ramps up gradually so that even seasoned veterans
should find something interesting for them.

The lessons are presented as tasks and solutions. This makes the lessons also suitable for
self-examination, if you avoid looking at the solutions.

Have fun, and welcome to the academy!
