# Basic lessons

The lessons in this chapter cover basic tasks, that are essential for any project using LynxKite.

## Looking at data from a CSV

I have a large CSV file on a USB stick. How can I load it in LynxKite just to take a look?

To "take a look" we need to put this data into a LynxKite project.

- On the opening page click _"New project"_.
- Give the project a name.
- Hit _"Create"_.

You now have a blank project.

LynxKite is focused on _graphs_. Everything is described in terms of _vertices_ and _edges_. But it
is perfectly suitable for analyzing non-graph data. A graph with no edges is just a set of vertices.
A graph like that is exactly the same as a plain old dataset, such as our CSV. We can just load
the CSV and look at each row as if it were a vertex in a graph with no edges.

- Open the _Import operations_ (+++<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-import"></i>+++).
- Choose _Import vertices_.

This operation can import from an existing table, but we have no tables at the moment.

- Click the +++<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-import"></i>+++ button on the right to create a new
table.
- Enter a table name (this will be useful if you want to use the same CSV in another project
later).
- Pick _"CSV files"_ for the data type.
- If you have the file on HDFS, you can enter the path here. But if it is indeed on a USB stick, hit
the upload button (+++<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud-upload"></i>+++), select the file, and
wait until the upload finishes.
- If your CSV has a header, uses commas for separating the fields, and you want to import everything
from it, leave all the settings at their defaults.
- Click _"Import CSV files"_ to create the table.
- Click _"OK"_ to import the table into the project.

You will see a number of progress indicators go wild. The spinners indicate that a particular piece
of data is being calculated, for example the number of vertices (rows in the CSV). The colorful
blocks in the bottom right correspond to Apache Spark computation units. They will give you a
measure of the speed of progress being made.

Even before all the animations finish, you can start working with your project. Execute some
filters, run some operations. You can even export the results! LynxKite will enqueue all this work
and keep itself busy until all your requests are fulfilled.
