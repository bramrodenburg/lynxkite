## Installing the LynxKite binaries

The LynxKite archive contains the following:

- *kite_<version_number>*: This directory contains the LynxKite binary and libraries.
- *run-kite-<version_number>.sh*: This is a symlink for starting the program.
- *spark-<version_number>*: This directory contains the version of Apache Spark used by LynxKite.

Simply uncompress the archive to a directory. Make sure to unpack the archive on the target
Linux platform. Unpacking on Windows then copying is known to cause problems.

Optionally you can also download the pre-built Apache Spark from the
http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html/[Spark webpage] after determining the right Spark version
from the `conf/SPARK_VERSION` file and the version of Hadoop.
