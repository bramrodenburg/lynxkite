## LynxKite configuration files

Starting or deploying LynxKite requires certain properly set environment variables. As explained
before LynxKite ships with template files for these configurations. The following sections specify
these variables in specific setups. If the example code starts with the `#` sign it means the
variable is disabled by default in the shipped corresponding template file.

include::kiterc.asciidoc[]

include::emr.asciidoc[]
