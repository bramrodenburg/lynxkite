# LynxKite backup

## Making backup

If LynxKite was started with `KITE_DATA_DIR` pointing to an S3 bucket, then there is
an easy way to backup all the project information and computed data. For admin users
there is an `backup` menu entry in the `Settings` menu.

## Backup configuration

This `backup` function is only usable, when LynxKite was started
with proper AWS credentials, and the environment variables `KITE_DATA_DIR` and
`KITE_EPHEMERAL_DATA_DIR` are set according to the admin manual.

A typical configuration may look like this:

        KITE_DATA_DIR=s3://bucket_name/
        KITE_EPHEMERAL_DATA_DIR=hdfs://hostname:port/hdfs/location/

The backup process copies the data from `KITE_EPHEMERAL_DATA_DIR` to `KITE_DATA_DIR` and
also copies LynxKite metadata to `KITE_DATA_DIR/metadata_backup/VERSION/`, where
VERSION is the current timestamp at the time of the backup.

The location of this metadata backup may look like this:

        s3://bucket_name/metadata_backup/VERSION/

VERSION is a timestamp in the form `YYYYMMddHHmmss`.
