## Snapshots

Snapshots are saved box output states from workspaces. Once a snapshot is saved (see
<<saving-snapshots>>) it is detached from all workspaces. A snapshot can be of any type that a
box output can, such as a <<Project state, project>> or a <<Table state, table>>.

Snapshots can be loaded back into a workspace with an <<Import snapshot>> box.
