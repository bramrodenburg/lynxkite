## SQL interface on the project browser page

There is a SQL interface on the project browser page that can be expanded by clicking on the plus
button and which can be used to make queries to all available projects in the current folder
(those in subfolders included). To refer to the table you want to access, you first need to provide the path from
your current folder to the project, then use `|` to specify the table you want to access. It is important to keep
in mind that you need to enclose all of this between two `{backtick}` symbols (_see example below_).

For example, let's say you are in your private folder where you have a subfolder called Premier_League, in which you
have a project named Arsenal. If you want to access the vertices table of the Arsenal project from your private folder,
you need to refer to it by `{backtick}Premier_League/Arsenal|vertices{backtick}`. In case you are already in the
`Premier_League` folder, the reference shortens to `{backtick}Arsenal|vertices{backtick}`

The SQL interface on the project browser page can also be used to reference tables not imported into projects. For
example, let's say you have a table called Players which has the data of all football players playing in the
Premier League. Then you can reference it the same way as the tables in projects: e.g. you can list all Arsenal players
with `select * from {backtick}Players{backtick} where team = "Arsenal"`. Notice that you still need to enclose the
table name between two {backtick} symbols.

See the section on <<sql-box>> for more details on the usage of the SQL interface.
