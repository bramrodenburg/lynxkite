## SQL interface on the project browser page

There is a SQL interface on the project browser page that can be expanded by clicking on the plus
button and which can be used to make queries to all available projects in the current folder
(those in subfolders included). To refer to the table you want to access, you first need to provide the path from
your current folder to the project, then use `|` to specify the table you want to access. It is important to keep
in mind that you need to enclose all of this between two `&#96;` symbols (_see example below_).

For example, let's say you are in your private folder where you have a subfolder called Premier_League, in which you
have a project named Arsenal. If you want to access the vertices table of the Arsenal project from your private folder,
you need to refer to it by `&#96;Premier_League/Arsenal|vertices&#96;`. In case you are already in the
`Premier_League` folder, the reference shortens to `&#96;Arsenal|vertices&#96;`

See the section on <<sql-box>> for more details on the usage of the SQL interface.
