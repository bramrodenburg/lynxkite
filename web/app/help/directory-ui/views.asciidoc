## Views

Views are lightweight data definitions, that are computed only when they are used. This leads
to a speedup if only a small part of the data is needed e.g. when you select something
with the global SQL box. Views are never transformed into LynxKite's internal columnar
data format which is beneficial if you never want to build graphs or only build from sampled data.

Because the views are computed only on use, the accessed resources need to be present whenever
the view is used e.g. if you import through JDBC, the database must still be available
 when the view is used.
