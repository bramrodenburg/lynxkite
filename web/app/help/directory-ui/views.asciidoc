## Views

Views are essentially tables, that are created only when they are used. This leads
to a speedup if only a small part of the data is needed e.g. when you select something
with the global SQL box.

Please note that because the views are loaded only on use, the accessed resources need to be present when
the view is used e.g. if you import through JDBC, the database must still be available
 when the view is used.
