## Views

Views are ligthweigth data definitions, that are created only when they are used. This leads
to a speedup if only a small part of the data is needed e.g. when you select something
with the global SQL box. Views are never transformed into the LynxKite's internal columnar
data format which is beneficial if you never want to build graphs or only build from sampled data.

Please note that because the views are computed only on use, the accessed resources need to be present whenever
the view is used e.g. if you import through JDBC, the database must still be available
 when the view is used.
