+++ to create a new, empty workspace inside the current folder. The workspace immediately opens when
created and you can start importing data into it.

Access the dropdown menu for a workspace in the workspace browser
(+++<a href class="btn-dropdown dropdown-toggle" dropdown-toggle><span class="caret"></span></a>+++)
to discard, duplicate, or rename the workspace. The rename command also makes it possible to move the
workspace to a different path.

Discarding a workspace moves it to the _Trash_ folder in your home folder. This provides means to
undo a deletion: just navigate to _Trash_ and move the workspace back to its original location.
Discarding a workspace that is already inside _Trash_ deletes it irretrievably. Delete _Trash_ to
discard everything inside permanently.
