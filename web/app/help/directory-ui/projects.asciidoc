to discard, duplicate, or rename the project. The rename command also makes it possible to move the
project to a different path.

Discarding a project moves it to the _Trash_ folder in your home folder. This provides a means to
undo a deletion: just navigate to _Trash_ and move the project back to its original location.
Discarding a project that is already inside _Trash_ deletes it irretrievably. Delete _Trash_ to
discard everything inside permanently.
