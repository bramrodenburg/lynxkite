## Tables

Tables represent simple record-oriented data in LynxKite. Tables can be imported from external data
sources like files or databases, or they can be created from SQL queries on graphs. Tables are very
much like files: they just sit there and store the data. A table has to be imported into a project
to start working with it. See the import operations on projects for more details.

Access the dropdown menu for a table in the project browser
(+++<a href class="btn-dropdown dropdown-toggle" dropdown-toggle><span class="caret"></span></a>+++)
to discard, duplicate, or rename the table. The rename command also makes it possible to move the
table to a different path.

The import operations also allow creating tables, but a table can also be created from the project
browser. Click +++
<span class="project-list" style="display: inline-block;">
  <span class="entry" style="display: block;">
    <span style="display: block;" class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span>
    <span class="lead">Import table</span>
  </span>
</span>
+++ to create a table inside the current folder.
