[[sql-box]]
## SQL interface

There is a SQL interface at the bottom of project pages that
makes it possible to run SQL queries over the data in the project and export the results.

The following tables are available for SQL access:

 - All the vertex attributes can be accessed in the `vertices` table.
+
Example: `select count(*) from vertices where age < 30`

 - All the edge attributes can be accessed in the `edge_attributes` table.
+
Example: `select max(weight) from edge_attributes`
+
You can not query the `edge_attributes` table if there are no edge attributes, even if the edges
themselves are defined.

 - All the edge and vertex attributes can be accessed in the `edges` table. Each row of this
table represents an edge. The attributes of the edge are prefixed with `edge_`, while the attributes
of the source and destination vertices are prefixed with `src_` and `dst_` respectively.
+
Example: `select max(edge_weight) from edges where src_age < dst_age`

 - The `belongs_to` table is defined for each segmentation of a project or a segmentation. It contains
the vertex attributes for the connected pairs of base and segmentation vertices prefixed with `base_`
and `segment_` respectively.
+
Example (work on the segment side): `select * from belongs_to`
+
The tables of segmentations can also be accessed using the
`{backtick}segmentation name.table name{backtick}` syntax from the base side.
+
Examples (work on the base side):

 * `select count(*) from {backtick}communities.belongs_to{backtick} group by segment_id`
 * `select base_name from {backtick}communities.belongs_to{backtick} where segment_name = "COOKING"`

+
The backticks are used for escaping the table name with special characters.

Click the +++<label class="btn btn-primary">Show results</label>+++ button or press Ctrl-Enter to
run the query.
The result will be limited to the first 10 lines by default, but you can also set this size limit
explicitly.

Every query you run is saved locally, and the 100 most recent queries are also saved in your
browser's local storage thus preserving them between different tabs, windows, and even sessions.
You can navigate in the query history by pressing Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down
(Command+Up and Command+Down on Mac) in the text area of the SQL interface.

You can browse the list of available tables and columns by clicking on the
+++<label class="btn btn-primary">Tables ‚èµ</label>+++
button.

## Exporting data

The <<sql-box>> is the way to export data from LynxKite to files and databases.

Click the +++<label class="btn btn-primary">Save results...</label>+++ button and configure the
output file format or database then press the
+++<label class="btn btn-primary">Save results</label>+++ button.

The supported output formats and their respective options are described in the following sections.
LynxKite fully interoperates with all of these formats. (Both import and export are supported.)

[[export-csv]]
### CSV

CSV stands for comma-separated values. It is a common human-readable file format where each record
is on a separate line and fields of the record are simply separated with a comma or other delimiter.
CSV does not store data types, so all fields become strings when exporting to this format.

====
[[path]] Path::
The distributed file-system path of the output file. It defaults to `<download>`, in which case the
output file will be downloaded through the browser. This is the simplest option for small data sets.

[[delimiter]] Delimiter::
The delimiter separating the fields in each line.

[[quote]] Quote::
The character used for quoting strings that contain the delimiter. If the string also contains the
quote character, it will be escaped with a backslash (`{backslash}`).

[[header]] Include header::
Whether or not to include the header in the CSV file. If the data is exported as multiple CSV files
the header will be included in each of them. When such a data set is directly downloaded, the header
will appear multiple times in the resulting file.
====

[[export-json]]
### JSON

JSON is a rich human-readable data format. It produces larger files than CSV but can represent
data types. Each line of the file stores one record encoded as a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[JSON] object.

====
[[path]] Path::
The distributed file-system path of the output file. It defaults to `<download>`, in which case the
output file will be downloaded through the browser. This is the simplest option for small data sets.
====

[[export-parquet]]
### Apache Parquet

https://parquet.apache.org/[Apache Parquet] is a columnar data storage format.

====
[[path]] Path::
The distributed file-system path of the output file.
====

[[export-orc]]
### Apache ORC

https://orc.apache.org/[Apache ORC] is a columnar data storage format.

====
[[path]] Path::
The distributed file-system path of the output file.
====

[[export-jdbc]]
### JDBC

JDBC is used to connect to relational databases such as MySQL. See <<jdbc-details>> for setup steps
required for connecting to a database.

====
[[url]] JDBC URL::
The connection URL for the database. This typically includes the username and password. The exact
syntax entirely depends on the database type. Please consult the documentation of the database.

[[table]] Table::
The name of the database table to export to.

[[mode]] Mode::
Describes whether LynxKite should expect a table to already exist and how to handle this case.
+
**The table must not exist** means the table will be created and it is an error if it already
exists.
+
**Drop the table if it already exists** means the table will be deleted and re-created if
it already exists. Use this mode with great care.
+
**Insert into an existing table** requires the
table to already exist and it will add the exported data at the end of the existing table.
====

[[export-lynxkite-table]]
### LynxKite table

The results of a query can also be saved as a LynxKite table. This makes it possible to make further
use of the data via any of the import operations in a project.

====
[[table]] Table::
The full path of the table to be created.
====

[[export-lynxkite-view]]
### LynxKite view

The results of a query can also be saved as a LynxKite view. This is very similar to a table, but the
values are obtained dynamically, i.e. if you export as view, then change data that is referred to by
the view, further queries on the view will return updated results. See <<views>> for further details.

[[export-segmentation-shorthand]]
### Segmentation
In case of a project, the export functionality can also be used to invoke the <<create-segmentation-from-sql>>
operation.
