## SQL interface

There is a SQL interface at the bottom of project pages that
makes it possible to run SQL queries over the data in the project and export the results.

The following tables are available for SQL access:

 - All the vertex attributes can be accessed in the `vertices` table.
+
Example: `select count(*) from vertices where age < 30`

 - All the edge attributes can be accessed in the `edge_attributes` table.
+
Example: `select max(weight) from edge_attributes`

 - All the Scalars can be accessed in the `scalars` table.
+
Example: `select `!vertex_count` from scalars`
+
You can not query the `edge_attributes` table if there are no edge attributes, even if the edges
themselves are defined.

 - All the edge and vertex attributes can be accessed in the `edges` table. Each row of this
table represents an edge. The attributes of the edge are prefixed with `edge_`, while the attributes
of the source and destination vertices are prefixed with `src_` and `dst_` respectively.
+
Example: `select max(edge_weight) from edges where src_age < dst_age`

 - The `belongs_to` table is defined for each segmentation of a project or a segmentation. It contains
the vertex attributes for the connected pairs of base and segmentation vertices prefixed with `base_`
and `segment_` respectively.
+
Example (work on the segment side): `select * from belongs_to`
+
The tables of segmentations can also be accessed using the
`{backtick}segmentation name.table name{backtick}` syntax from the base side.
+
Examples (work on the base side):

 * `select count(*) from {backtick}communities.belongs_to{backtick} group by segment_id`
 * `select base_name from {backtick}communities.belongs_to{backtick} where segment_name = "COOKING"`

+
The backticks are used for escaping the table name with special characters.

Click the +++<label class="btn btn-primary">Show results</label>+++ button or press Ctrl-Enter to
run the query.
The result will be limited to the first 10 lines by default, but you can also set this size limit
explicitly.

Every query you run is saved locally, and the 100 most recent queries are also saved in your
browser's local storage thus preserving them between different tabs, windows, and even sessions.
You can navigate in the query history by pressing Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down
(Command+Up and Command+Down on Mac) in the text area of the SQL interface.

You can browse the list of available tables and columns by clicking on the
+++<label class="btn btn-primary">Tables ‚èµ</label>+++
button.
