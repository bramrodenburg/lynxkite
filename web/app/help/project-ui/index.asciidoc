# Projects

Projects are a rich box output type that represent graphs and their segmentations in one bundle.
The <<state-popups,state popup>> for a project output shows basic information about the graph,
such as the number of vertices and edges. It lists the scalars, attributes, and segmentations.
Scalar values are displayed, attribute histograms are available on click, and segmentations can be
opened to dig deeper.
