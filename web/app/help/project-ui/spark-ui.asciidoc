## Apache Spark status

LynxKite uses Apache Spark as its distributed computation backend.
The status of the backend is reflected by the elements in the bottom right corner of the page.

A single LynxKite operation is often performed as a sequence of multiple Spark stages.
A single Spark stage is further subdivided into Spark tasks. Tasks are the smallest
unit of work. Each task is assigned to one of the machines in the cluster.

The rotating cogwheel in the bottom right indicates that Spark is calculating something.

The _Stop calculation_ button appears when you hover over the cogwheel. It sends an interruption
signal to Spark. This signal aborts work on all Spark stages. The tasks that are in progress will
still be finished, but the outstanding tasks and stages will be cancelled.
The button cancels all Spark stages, not just the ones initiated by the user pressing the button.
For this reason the button is restricted to admin users.

The little colorful rectangles represent Spark stages. The height of the rectangle indicates
the percentage of tasks completed in the stage. The color corresponds to the type of work it does.
