## Machine learning models

Machine learning models are one of the graph attribute types.
They are created by a machine learning operation (for example <<train-linear-regression-model>>)
and used for prediction with the <<predict-from-model>> operation or classification with the
<<classify-vertices-with-model>> operation.

### Method

The machine learning algorithm used to create this model.

### Label

The name of the attribute that this model is trained to predict. (The dependent variable.)

This will not appear for unsupervised machine learning models.

### Scaling

Details about the pre-processing scaling step applied to the features before training. The two
phases are centering and scaling. The first phase (centering) centers the data with mean before scaling,
i.e., the mean is subtracted from all elements. The data set acquired this way has a mean of 0.
The second phase (scaling) is acquired by dividing all the elements by the standard deviation.
The means and deviations in these steps are computed columnwise.

Suppose we have an original data item (a, b). After these two steps, the data item that
is used for the training will be ((a-m1)/d1, (b-m2)/d2), where m1 and d1 are the mean
and the standard deviation for the first column (the a's) and m2 and d2 are the mean
and the standard deviation for the second column (the b's).

Note that both steps are optional: it depends on the model, whether they are applied or not.

### Features

The list of the feature attributes that this model uses for predictions.
(The independent variables.)

### Details

For linear regression models:

* `intercept` is the constant parameter in the linear equation the model uses to predict.
* `weights` is the vector of the regression coefficients.

For KMeans clustering model:

* `cluster centers` are the vectors of the KMeans cluster centers.
