## Machine learning models

Machine learning models are one of the graph attribute types.
They are created by a machine learning operation (for example <<train-linear-regression-model>>)
and used for prediction with the <<predict-from-model>> operation.

### Method

The machine learning algorithm used to create this model.

### Label

The name of the attribute that this model is trained to predict. (The dependent variable.)

### Features

The list of the feature attributes that this model uses for predictions.
(The independent variables.)

### Details

For linear regression models:

* `intercept` is the constant parameter in the linear equation the model uses to predict.
* `weights` is the vector of the regression coefficients.
