## Segmentations

Segmentations are connected sub-projects. The segmentation of a project is a graph, just like the
graph in the base project. The vertices of the segmentation are also called "segments".
A set of edges exists between the base project and its segmentation, representing membership
in a segment. (To distinguish these special edges we also call them "links".)

For example the <<find-maximal-cliques>> operation creates a new segmentation, in which each segment
represents a clique in the base project. Vertices of the base project are linked to the segments
which represent cliques that they belong to.

Segmentations serve as the foundation of many advanced operations. For example the average age
for each clique can be calculated using the <<aggregate-to-segmentation>> operation and the
average size of the cliques that a person belongs to can be calculated with
<<aggregate-from-segmentation>>.

Segmentations can be opened on the right hand side by clicking them and choosing _"Open"_ in the
menu. They can be visualized the usual way. The links are displayed when both the base project
and its segmentation are visualized. This works when both sides are visualized as bucketed graphs,
when they are visualized as concrete vertices, or even when one side is bucketed and the other is
concrete. This can be used to gain unique insights about the structure of relationships in the
graph.

Segmentations act much like projects, and you can even import existing projects to act as
segmentations. (In this case it is possible that the links will represent a relationship other
than membership.) Segmentations, however, do not have their own operation history. Their history
is part of the base project's history. This also affects the undo button.
