## Ray tracing

LynxKite has an experimental feature for generating ray traced graph visualizations. These
visualizations can give simple graphs a more striking look in presentations and marketing
materials.

Click +++<img src="images/render50.png">+++ to get a relatively quick draft render. If you are
satisfied with the layout, click _"Render in high quality"_ to get the final render. Right-click the
final image to save it locally.

Ray tracing currently supports the following visualization features:

 - Vertex colors.
 - Vertex sizes.
 - Highlighting of center vertex.
 - Vertex shapes are translated to simpler 3D shapes.
 - The relative layout and scaling will be reproduced exactly. Only the camera positioning is
   different.

The rendered image is generated to match the width and height of the popup. Make the popup smaller
for faster render times, or larger for higher resolution. The generated picture has a transparent
background.
