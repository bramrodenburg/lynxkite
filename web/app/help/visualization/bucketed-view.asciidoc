## Bucketed view

Shows a consolidated view of all the vertices of the graph. Vertices can be grouped by up to two
attributes and the system visualizes the sizes of the groups and the amount of edges going among
the groups.

For `String` attributes, the created buckets will correspond to the possible values of the
attribute.
If the attribute has more possible values than the number of buckets selected by the user then the
program will show buckets for the most frequent values and creates an extra `Other` bucket for the
rest.

For `Double` attributes buckets will correspond to intervals. We split the interval `[min, max]`
(where `min` and `max` are the minimum and maximum values of the attribute respectively)
into subintervals of the same length. E.g. we might end up with buckets `[0, 10)`,
`[10, 20)`, `[20, 30]`.

If _logarithmic mode_ is selected for the attribute then the subintervals are
selected so that they have the same length on the logarithmic scale. E.g. a possible
bucketing is `[1, 2)`, `[2, 4)`, `[4, 8]`. In logarithmic mode, if the attribute has any
non-positive values, then an extra bucket will be created which will contain all non-positive values.
