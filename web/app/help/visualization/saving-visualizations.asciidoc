## Saving visualizations

You can save your current visualization settings using the `Save Visualization` button (only visible
when visualization is enabled). Just type a name, press `Save Visualization` again and a new
entry with the name you have given will show up in the `Attributes of the graph` section.

You can reload the saved visualization options by pressing on the
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></i></label>+++
button next to the newly created graph attribute.
