## Saving visualizations

You can save your current visualization settings using the _"Save visualization"_ option in the
visualization settings menu. Just type a name, press Enter. A
new entry with the name you have given will show up in the _Graph attributes_ section.

You can reload the saved visualization options by clicking the saved settings, and picking _"Load
visualization"_ in the drop-down menu.
