## Saving visualizations

You can save your current visualization settings using the _"Save visualization"_ button (only
visible when visualization is enabled). Just type a name, press _"Save visualization"_ again and a
new entry with the name you have given will show up in the _Graph attributes_ section.

You can reload the saved visualization options by clicking the saved settings, and _"Load
visualization"_ in the drop-down menu.
