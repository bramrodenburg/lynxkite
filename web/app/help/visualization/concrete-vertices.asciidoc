## Concrete vertices view

Shows some selected [[center-vertices]]center vertices and their neighborhood with all the edges
among these vertices. The set of the center vertices and the size of the neighborhood can be
selected by the user.

When this mode is selected the user is presented with a set of extra controls below the
<<project-header>>:

[[concrete-view-settings]]
Display::
You can select between 2D and 3D visualization. 3D allows for showing more vertices efficiently but
that mode has less features. You cannot (yet) visualize attributes in 3D mode and cannot select and
move around vertices.

Layout animation::
(Only in 2D mode) If enabled, layout animation will continuously do a physical simulation on the
displayed graph as if edges were springs. You can move vertices around and the graph will
reorganize itself.

Label attraction::
When animation is enabled, this will make vertices with the same label attract each other, which
results in same label vertices being grouped together.

Layout style::
When animation is enabled, this option determines the exact physics of the simulation.
The different options can be useful depending on the structure of the network that is visualized.
+
The available options are:
+
Centralize::: High-degree nodes in the center, low-degree nodes on the periphery.
Decentralize::: Low-degree nodes in the center, high-degree nodes on the periphery.
Neutral::: Degree is not factored into the layout.

Show vertices::
Lists "center" vertices, that is the vertices whose neighborhood we are displaying. You can change
this list manually, using the <<pick-button,Pick button>> or using the
<<context-menu,context menu>> of already displayed vertices. Setting an asterisk (`+*+`) here will
result in the visualization of all the vertices (up to a certain limit).

Show neighborhood::
You can set the neighborhood radius from 0 to 10. 0 means center vertices only. 1 means center
vertices and their immediate neighbors. 2 also contains neighbors of neighbors. And so on.

### Pick button
This button is used to populate the contents of the _Show vertices_ box. The vertex
placed there will be one that satisfies all the currently set restrictions (see
below).
The available options are:

Center count:: The number of vertices placed in the _Show vertices_ box (default: 1).

Restrictions narrow down the potential set of candidates that will be
placed in the _Show vertices_ box when you click on the _Pick_ button. They have the same syntax as
filters (see  <<attribute-filter-syntax>>). There are two ways to specify them:

Use project attribute filters::
(Default.) Use the currently set vertex attribute filters as restrictions.
Use custom restrictions::
Manually enter restrictions. When switching to this mode, the project filters
are automatically copied into the custom restriction list, which can be edited then.

After picking one set of centers with the _Pick_ button the button is replaced by the _Next_ button.
Clicking this button will iterate over samples that match the conditions. The samples will show up
in a deterministic order. You can skip to an arbitrary sample by clicking on the
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i></label>+++
button. There you can manually enter a position in the sequence and pick it by clicking on
 _Pick by offset:_

### Context menu
When clicking a vertex in Concrete Vertex View you can see a context menu with possible operations
related to the vertex. Here are the possible menu elements:

Add to centers::
This action will add the selected vertex to the centers.

Set as only center::
This action will set this vertex as the only center so that only this vertex and its neighborhood
will be shown.

Filter segmentation to this vertex::
It will setup a filter on the segmentation
graph such that only segments that contain this vertex are selected. This menu is only available if
a segmentation is open on the right side.

Freeze/unfreeze::
If using layout animation, freeze fixes the position of this particular vertex. Unfreeze lets
the vertex move free again.
