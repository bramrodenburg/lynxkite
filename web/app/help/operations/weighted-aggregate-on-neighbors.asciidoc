### Weighted aggregate on neighbors

Aggregates across the vertices that are connected to each vertex. Because it works by looking at
edges, neighbors that are connected with more than one edge will be counted more than once.

// TODO: Update this when #1659 is done.

For example it can calculate the average age per kilogram of the friends of each person.
