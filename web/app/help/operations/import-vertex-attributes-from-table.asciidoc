### Import vertex attributes from table

Imports vertex attributes for existing vertices from a table. This is
useful when you already have vertices and just want to import one or more attributes.

====
include::{g}[tag=table-import]

[[id-attr]] Vertex ID attribute::
The vertex attribute which is used in the table's ID column.

[[id-column]] ID column::
The ID column name in the table. This should be a string column that uses the same IDs as
the chosen vertex ID attribute.

[[prefix]] Name prefix for the imported vertex attributes::
Prepend this prefix string to the new vertex attribute names. This can be used to avoid
accidentally overwriting existing attributes.
