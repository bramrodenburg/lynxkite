### Export edge attributes to file

Writes the edges and their attributes to a text file.
The first two columns of the file will contain the source and destination vertex IDs.

include::{g}[tag=file-export]

====
[[path]] Destination path::
The file to write to. Must use <<prefixed-paths>>.

[[link]] Download link name::
A new scalar will be created under this name. You can download the exported file through this link.

[[attrs]] Attributes::
Attributes to export.

[[id_attr]] Vertex id attribute::
The attribute that identifies the source and the destination vertices in the output.
By default, this will be the internal vertex ID (which is guaranteed to be unique).
However, you might find it more convenient to use some other vertex attribute, e.g., a phone number.

[[format]] File format::
Only CSV (comma-separated values) is currently supported.
