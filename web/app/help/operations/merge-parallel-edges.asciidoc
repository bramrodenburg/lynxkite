## Merge parallel edges

Multiple edges going from A to B will be merged into a single edge.
The edges going from A to B are not merged with edges going from B to A.

For example, this operation can be used to turn a call data graph into a relationship
graph. Multiple calls will count as one relationship. To find the strength of
this relationship, you either take the count of calls, or total duration, or the total
cost, etc.

Edge attributes can be aggregated across the merged edges.
