## Derived vertex attribute

Generates a new attribute based on existing attributes. The value expression can be
an arbitrary JavaScript expression, and it can refer to existing attributes as if they
were local variables. For example you can write `age * 2` to generate a new attribute
that is the double of the age attribute. Or you can write
`gender == 'Male' ? 'Mr ' + name : 'Ms ' + name` for a more complex example.
