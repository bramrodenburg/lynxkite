### Import project as segmentation

Copies another project into a new segmentation for this one. There will be no
connections between the segments and the base vertices. You can import/create those via
other operations (see <<load-segmentation-links-from-csv>> and
<<define-segmentation-links-from-matching-attributes>>).

Note that you cannot import the project itself as segmentation; only other projects
can be used here. If you need to import the project into itself as segmentation, you
can either make a copy of it first and import the copy, or use <<project-as-its-own-segmentation>>.
