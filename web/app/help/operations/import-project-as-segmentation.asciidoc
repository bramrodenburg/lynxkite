## Import project as segmentation

Copies another project into a new segmentation for this one. There will be no
connections between the segments and the base vertices. You can import/create those via
other operations (see <<load-segmentation-links-from-csv>> and
<<define-segmentation-links-from-matching-attributes>>).
