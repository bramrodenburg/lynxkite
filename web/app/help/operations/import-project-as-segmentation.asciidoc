## Import project as segmentation

Copies another project into a new segmentation for this one. There will be no
connections between the segments and the base vertices. You can import/create those via
other operations (see
link:{help}load-segmentation-links-from-csv[Load segmentation links from CSV] and
link:{help}define-segmentation-links-from-matching-attributes[
  Define segmentation links from matching attributes]).
