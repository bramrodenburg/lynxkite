### Import union of table snapshots

Makes the union of a set of previously saved table snapshots accessible from the workspace
as a single table.

====
[[paths]] Paths::
The comma separated set of full paths to the snapshots in LynxKite's virtual filesystem.

 - Each path has to refer to a table snapshot.
 - The tables have to have the same schema.
 - The output table will union the input tables in the same order as defined here.
