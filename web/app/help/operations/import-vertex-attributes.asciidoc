### Import vertex attributes

Imports vertex attributes for existing vertices from a table. This is
useful when you already have vertices and just want to import one or more attributes.

====
include::{g}[tag=table-import]

[[id-attr]] Vertex ID attribute::
The vertex attribute which is used in the table's ID column.

[[id-column]] ID column::
The ID column name in the table. This should be a string column that uses the same IDs as
the chosen vertex ID attribute.

[[prefix]] Name prefix for the imported vertex attributes::
Prepend this prefix string to the new vertex attribute names. This can be used to avoid
accidentally overwriting existing attributes.

[[unique-keys]] Unique keys::
Asserts that the vertex ID attribute values have to be unique if set true. The values of the
matching ID column in the table have to be unique in both cases.
