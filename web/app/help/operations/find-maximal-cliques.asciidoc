### Find maximal cliques

Creates a segmentation of vertices based on the maximal cliques they are the member of.
A maximal clique is a maximal set of vertices where there is an edge between every two vertex.
Since one vertex can be part of multiple maximal cliques this segmentation might be overlapping.

====
[[name]] Segmentation name::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[[bothdir]] Edges required in both directions::
Whether edges have to exist in both directions between all members of a clique.
+
=====
If the direction of the edges is not important, set this to `false`. This will allow placing two
vertices into the same clique even if they are only connected in one direction.
=====

[[min]] Minimum clique size::
Cliques smaller than this will not be collected.
+
This improves the performance of the algorithm, and small cliques are often not a good indicator
anyway.
