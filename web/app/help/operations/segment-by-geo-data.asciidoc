### Segment by GEO data

Creates a segmentation from the features in a Shapefile. A vertex is connected to a segment if the
the `position` vertex attribute is within a specified distance from the segment's geometry
attribute. Feature attributes from the Shapefile become segmentation attributes.

* The lookup depends on the coordinate reference system and distance metric of the feature. All
  inputs must use the same coordinate reference system and distance metric.
* This algorithm creates an overlapping segmentation since one vertex can be sufficiently close to
  multiple GEO segments.

Shapefiles can be obtained from various sources, like
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles[OpenStreetMap].

*Parameters*

[[name]] Name::
The name of the new GEO segmentation.

[[position]] Position::
The (latitude, longitude) location tuple.

[[shapefile]] Shapefile::
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile[Shapefile] used for the lookup. The list is created from
the files in the `KITE_META/resources/shapefiles` directory. A Shapefile consist of a `.shp`, `.shx`
and `.dbf` file of the same name.

[[distance]] Distance::
Vertices are connected to GEO segments if within this distance. The distance has to use the same
metric and coordinate reference system as the features within the Shapefile.
