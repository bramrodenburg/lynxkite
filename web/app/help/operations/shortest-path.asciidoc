### Shortest path

Calculates the shortest path from a given set of vertices for every vertex.

====
[[name]] Attribute name::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[[weights]] Weight attribute::
The edge weights. Edges with greater weight correspond to higher distance.

[[seed]] Seed attribute::
A numeric attribute that specifies the distances already known before starting
this operation. If you want to compute distances from a given vertex, then
define this attribute to have the value 0.0 at that vertex, and leave it
undefined for all the others.

[[iterations]] Maximum number of iterations::
This is an iterative algorithm. In each iteration, it takes all the vertices with
known distances and calculates updated distance values for their neighbors.
This goes on until all the distances have stabilized, or the number of iterations
has reached this number.
