## Connected components

Creates a segment for every connected set of vertices.
In other words, this operation finds the subgraphs (connected components) in a graph, in which 
any two or more vertices are connected to each other by paths,
but are connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.


====
[[name]] Segmentation name::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[[directions]] Edge direction::
Ignore directions:::
The algorithm adds reversed edges before calculating the components.
Require both directions:::
The algorithm discards non-symmetric edges before calculating the components.
