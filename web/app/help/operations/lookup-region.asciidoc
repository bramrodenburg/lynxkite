### Lookup region

For every `position` vertex attribute looks up features in a Shapefile and returns a specified
attribute.

* The lookup depends on the coordinate reference system of the feature. The input position must
  use the same coordinate reference system as the one specified in the Shapefile.
* If there are no matching features the output is omitted.
* If the specified attribute does not exist for any matching feature the output is omitted.
* If there are multiple suitable features the algorithm picks the first one.

Shapefiles can be obtained from various sources, like
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles[OpenStreetMap].

*Parameters*

[[position]] Position::
The (latitude, longitude) location tuple.

[[shapefile]] Shapefile::
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile[Shapefile] used for the lookup. The list is created from
the files in the `KITE_META/resources/shapefiles` directory. A Shapefile consist of a `.shp`, `.shx`
and `.dbf` file of the same name.

[[attribute]] Attribute from the Shapefile::
The attribute in the Shapefile used for the output.

[[onlyKnownFeatures]]: Only allow known features::
If set `true`, throws an error in case the Shapefile contains unknown shape types. Otherwise
silently ignores them.

[[output]] Output::
The name of the new vertex attribute.
