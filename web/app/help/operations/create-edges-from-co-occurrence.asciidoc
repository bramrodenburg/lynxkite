### Create edges from co-occurrence

Connects vertices in the parent project if they co-occur in any segments.
Multiple co-occurrences will result in multiple parallel edges. Loop edges
are generated for each segment that a vertex belongs to. The attributes of
the segment are copied to the edges created from it.

====
[[num_created_edges]] Number of edges to be created::
The number of edges this operation will create if executed in the current segmentation.
You can use this number to judge whether running this operation is feasible or not.
