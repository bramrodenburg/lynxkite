### Comment

Adds a comment to the workspace. As with any box, you can freely place your comment anywhere on the
workspace. Adding comments does not have any effect on the computation but can potentially make your
workflow easier to understand for others -- or even for your future self.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example[Markdown] can be used to present formatted text or
embed links and images.
