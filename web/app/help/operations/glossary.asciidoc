The database name is the JDBC connection string without the `jdbc:` prefix.
(For example `mysql://127.0.0.1/?user=batman&password=alfred`.)
An integer column must be specified as the key, and you have to select a key range.

tag::file-import[]

=====
LynxKite operations are typically deterministic. If you re-run an operation with
the same random seed, you will get the same results as before. To get a truly independent random
re-run, make sure you choose a different random seed.

The default value for random seed parameters is randomly picked, so only very
rarely do you need to give random seeds any thought.
