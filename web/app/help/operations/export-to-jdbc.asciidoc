### Export to JDBC

JDBC is used to connect to relational databases such as MySQL. See <<jdbc-details>> for setup steps
required for connecting to a database.

====
[p-url]#JDBC URL#::
The connection URL for the database. This typically includes the username and password. The exact
syntax entirely depends on the database type. Please consult the documentation of the database.

[p-table]#Table#::
The name of the database table to export to.

[p-mode]#Mode#::
Describes whether LynxKite should expect a table to already exist and how to handle this case.
+
**The table must not exist** means the table will be created and it is an error if it already
exists.
+
**Drop the table if it already exists** means the table will be deleted and re-created if
it already exists. Use this mode with great care.
+
**Insert into an existing table** requires the
table to already exist and it will add the exported data at the end of the existing table.
