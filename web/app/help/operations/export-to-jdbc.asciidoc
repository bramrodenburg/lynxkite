### Export to JDBC

JDBC is used to connect to relational databases such as MySQL. See <<jdbc-details>> for setup steps
required for connecting to a database.

====
[p-url]#JDBC URL#::
The connection URL for the database. This typically includes the username and password. The exact
syntax entirely depends on the database type. Please consult the documentation of the database.

[p-table]#Table#::
The name of the database table to export to.

[p-mode]#Mode#::
Describes whether LynxKite should expect a table to already exist and how to handle this case.
+
**The table must not exist** means the table will be created and it is an error if it already
exists.
+
**Drop the table if it already exists** means the table will be deleted and re-created if
it already exists. Use this mode with great care.
+
**Insert into an existing table** requires the
table to already exist and it will add the exported data at the end of the existing table.

[p-version]#Version#::
Version is the version number of the result of the export operation. It is a non negative integer.
LynxKite treats export operations as other operations: it remembers the result (which in this case
is the knowledge that the export was successfully done) and won't repeat the calculation. However,
there might be a need to export an already exported table with the same set of parameters (e.g. the
exported table is lost). In this case you need to change the version number, making that parameters
are not the same as in the previous export.
