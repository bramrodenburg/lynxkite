## Import vertices and edges from single CSV fileset

Imports edges from a CSV file or files. Each line in the CSV represents one edge.
Each field in the CSV will be accessible as an edge attribute.

Vertices will be generated for the endpoints of the edges with two vertex attributes:

 - `stringID` will contain the ID string that was used in the CSV.
 - `id` will contain the internal vertex ID.
