## Import vertices and edges from single CSV fileset

Imports edges from a CSV file or files. Each line in the CSV represents one edge.
Each field in the CSV will be accessible as an edge attribute.

This is useful when your fileset contains edges (e.g., calls) and there is no separate
fileset for vertices. This operation makes it possible to load edges and use them
as a graph. Note that this graph will never have zero-degree edges.

Vertices will be generated for the endpoints of the edges with two vertex attributes:

 - `stringID` will contain the ID string that was used in the CSV.
 - `id` will contain the internal vertex ID.

These two are the only vertex attributes that this graph has. The edge attributes, however,
will be imported from the fileset.
