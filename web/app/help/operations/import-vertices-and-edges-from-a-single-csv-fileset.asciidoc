## Import vertices and edges from single CSV fileset

Imports edges from a CSV file, or files. Each field in the CSV will be accessible as an edge
attribute.

Vertices will be generated for the endpoints of the edges with two vertex attributes:
 - `stringID` will contain the ID string that was used in the CSV.
 - `id` will contain the internal vertex ID.
