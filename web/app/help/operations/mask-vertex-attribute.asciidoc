### Mask vertex attribute

Uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2[PBDKF2] algorithm to mask an attribute: all values of the attribute
 get replaced by a seemingly random value. The same original values get replaced by the same new value and
different original values get (almost certainly) replaced by different new values.

As all operations, this one also can be undone in the project so it would only provide real masking if the data is
exported outside of the project.

====
[[attr]] Vertex attribute::
The attribute(s) which will be masked.

[[salt]] Salt::
The salt is choosen by the user and is used to the defend against attacks using a list of pre-computed hashes for the
 probable values (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table[rainbow table] attacks). As such, the length and
 the complexity of the salt do not directly impact the safety of the masked data. Thus, the salt only needs to be
 not trivial to guess for a potential attacker.
