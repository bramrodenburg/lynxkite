### Anchor

This special box represents the workspace itself. There is always exactly one instance of it. It
allows you to control workspace-wide settings as parameters on this box. It can also serve to anchor
your workspace with a high-level description.

====
[p-description]#Description#::
An overall description of the purpose of this workspace.

[p-parameters]#Parameters#::
Workspaces containing output boxes can be used as custom boxes in other workspaces. Here you can
define what parameters the custom box created from this workspace shall have.
+
Parameters can also be used as workspace-wide constants. For example if you want to import
`accounts-2017.csv` and `transactions-2017.csv`, you could create a `date` parameter with default
value set to `2017` and import the files as `accounts-$date.csv` and `transactions-$date.csv`. (Make
sure to mark these parametric file names as _parametric_.) This makes it easy to change the date for
all imported files at once later.
