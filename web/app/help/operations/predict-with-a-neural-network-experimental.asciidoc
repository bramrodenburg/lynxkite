### Predict with a neural network (EXPERIMENTAL)

*Warning! Experimental operation.*

Trains a neural network using the graph's vertex attributes and edges. Then uses
this trained neural network to make a prediction on the same graph.

Currently the computation is not distributed, so please do not use it on really
big graphs. It will be changed in the future.

Other significant changes are also possible in future versions. (The operation
might be renamed or split into a separate training and prediction operation,
some parameters might be added or removed, etc.)

====
[[label]] Attribute to predict::
The partially defined attribute that you want to predict. The current
implementation only supports attributes between -1 and 1.

[[output]] Save as::
The prediction will be saved as an attribute created under this name.

[[features]] Predictors::
The attributes that will be used as the input of the prediction.

[[networklayout]] Network layout:: There is a small network at every vertex.
At first the input for these small networks is the label of the corresponding
vertex and the sum of its neighbors' labels. Each vertex computes the output of
the small network on this input. After this, the input for the small network will
consist of the sum of its neighbors' outputs in the previous round and its own
previous output. Here you can set the layout of the small networks.
+
  - **MLP:** The small network is simple, it contains only a single hidden layer.
  But the layers can have different weights in different rounds.
  - **LSTM or GRU:** In these layouts the small network is more complicated.

  about LSTM and GRU.]

[[networksize]] Size of the network::
The number of nodes in one layer of the neural network.

[[radius]] Iterations in prediction::
The number of rounds when the vertices send information to their neighbors.

[[hidestate]] Hide own state::
If it is set to `true`, then the vertices do not know their own label, but their neighbors
can still see it.

[[forgetfraction]] Forget fraction::
In every training iteration each vertex forgets its label with the probability
given here. Neither the vertices themselves, nor their neighbors see the forgotten
labels.

[[knownlabelweight]] Weight for known labels::
If the forget fraction is greater than 0, then the errors from the non-forgetting
nodes are multiplied by this number. So if it is set to a small number, then the
errors from non-forgetting vertices count less than the ones from the forgetting
vertices.

[[numberoftrainings]] Number of trainings::
The training is performed on randomly chosen subgraphs. In the first round each
node gets a small subgraph and performs a few iterations of training. After this
the average of the learned weights is calculated. In the second round each node
gets another small subgraph and performs a few iterations of training, starting
from the average weights. After this, the average of the learned weights is
calculated again, and so on. You can set here the number of these turns.

[[iterationsintraining]] Iterations in training::
The number of iterations in one round of training.

[[subgraphsintraining]] Subgraphs in training::
The number of subgraphs chosen in one training round.

[[mintrainingvertices]] Minimum training subgraph size::
The minimum size of subgraphs chosen for training.

[[maxtrainingvertices]] Maximum training subgraph size::
The maximum size of subgraphs chosen for training.

[[trainingradius]] Radius for training subgraphs::
If 0, the whole graph is used as one single training subgraph. Otherwise
the subgraphs are chosen as follows. We choose a single vertex at random and get
all the vertices whose distance from the chosen one is at most this number.
If the number of these vertices is less than the minimum given above, then we choose
another node and get its environment. We repeat this procedure until there are
enough chosen vertices. If the number of these vertices is more than maximum
given above, then we drop the last few points.

[[seed]] Seed::
Random seed for initializing network weights and choosing subgraphs.

[[learningrate]] Learning rate::
Determines the size of the steps in the gradient descent algorithm.
