### Fill edge attributes with constant default values

An attribute may not be defined on every edge. This operation sets a default value
for the edges where it was not defined.

====
[[title]] Attributes::
Edge attributes of the project.

[[title2]]  Default values::
The value to set for vertices where the attribute is not defined. No change for
attributes for which the default value is left empty. The default value
must be numeric for `Double` attributes.
