### Create scale-free random edge bundle

Creates edges randomly so that the resulting graph is scale-free.

This is an iterative algorithm. We start with one edge per vertex and in each
iteration the number of edges gets approximately multiplied by
_Per iteration edge number multiplier_.

====
[[iterations]] Number of iterations::
Each iteration increases the number of edges by the specified multiplier.
A higher number of iteration will result in a more scale-free degree distribution,
but also a slower performance.

[[periterationmultiplier]] Per iteration edge number multiplier::
Each iteration increases the number of edges by the specified multiplier.
The edge count starts from the number of vertices, so with _N_ iterations and _m_
as the multiplier you will have _m^N^_ edges by the end.
