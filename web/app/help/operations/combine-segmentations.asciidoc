### Combine segmentations

Creates a new segmentation from the selected existing segmentations.
Each new segment corresponds to one original segment from each of the original
segmentations, and the new segment is the intersection of all the corresponding
segments. We keep non-empty resulting segments only. Edges between segmentations
are discarded.

If you have segmentations A and B with two segments each, such as:

 - A = { _"men"_, _"women"_ }
 - B = { _"people younger than 20"_, _"people older than 20"_ }

then the combined segmentation will have four segments:

  - { _"men younger than 20"_, _"men older than 20"_,
      _"women younger than 20"_, _"women older than 20"_ }
