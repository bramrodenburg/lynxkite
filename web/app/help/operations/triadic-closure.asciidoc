### Triadic closure

For every A{to}B{to}C triplet, creates an A{to}C edge. The original edges are discarded.
The new A{to}C edge gets the attributes of the original A{to}B and B{to}C edges with prefixes "ab_" and "bc_".

Be aware, in dense graphs a plenty of new edges can be generated.

Possible use case: we are looking for connections between vertices, like same subscriber with multiple devices.
We have an edge metric that we think is a good indicator, or we have a model that gives predictions for edges.
If we want to calculate this metric, and pick the edges with high values, it is possible that the edge
that would be the winner does not exist.
Often we think that a transitive closure would add the missing edge.
For example, I don't call my second phone, but I call a lot of the same people from the two phones.
