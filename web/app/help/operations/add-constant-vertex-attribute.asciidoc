### Add constant vertex attribute

Adds an attribute with a fixed value to every vertex.

====
*Example use case*

Create a constant vertex attribute with value 'A' to the graph in project A.
Then, create a constant vertex attribute with value 'B' to the graph in project B. Use the same
attribute name in both cases. From then on, if a union graph is created from these two graphs,
the vertex attribute will tell which graph the vertex originally belonged to.

*Parameters*

[[name]] Attribute name::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[[value]] Value::
The attribute value. Should be a number if _Type_ is set to `Double`.

[[type]] Type::
The operation can create either `Double` (numeric) or `String` typed attributes.
