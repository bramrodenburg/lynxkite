### Find modular clustering

Tries to find a partitioning of the vertices with high
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)[modularity].

Edges that go between vertices in the same segment increase modularity, while edges that go from
one segment to the other decrease modularity. The algorithm iteratively merges and splits segments
and moves vertices between segments until it cannot find changes that would significantly improve
the modularity score.

====
[p-name]#Segmentation name#::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[p-weights]#Weight attribute#::
The attribute to use as edge weights.

[p-max_iterations]#Maximum number of iterations to do#::
After this number of iterations we stop regardless of modularity increment. Use -1 for unlimited.

[p-min_increment_per_iteration]#Minimal modularity increment in an iteration to keep going#::
If the average modularity increment in the last few iterations goes below this then we stop
the algorithm and settle with the clustering found.
