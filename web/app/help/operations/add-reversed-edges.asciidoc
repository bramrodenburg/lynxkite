### Add reversed edges

For every A{to}B edge adds a new B{to}A edge, copying over the attributes of the original.
Thus this operation will double the number of edges in the project.

Using this operation you end up with a graph with symmetric edges: if A{to}B exists then
B{to}A also exists. This is the closest you can get to an "undirected" graph.
