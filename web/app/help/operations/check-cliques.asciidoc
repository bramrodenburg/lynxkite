## Check cliques

Validates that the segments of the segmentation are in fact cliques.

Creates a new `invalid_cliques` scalar, which lists non-clique segment IDs up to a certain number.

====
[[selected]] Segment IDs to check::
The validation can be restricted to a subset of the segments, resulting in quicker operation.

[[bothdir]] Edges required in both directions::
Whether edges have to exist in both directions between all members of a clique.
