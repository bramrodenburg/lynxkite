### Find triangles

Creates a segment for every triangle in the graph.
A triangle is defined as 3 pairwise connected vertices, regardless of the direction and number of edges between them.
This means that triangles with one or more multiple edges are still only counted once,
and the operation does not differentiate between directed and undirected triangles.
Since one vertex can be part of multiple triangles this segmentation might be overlapping.

[p-name]#Segmentation name#::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[p-bothdir]#Edges required in both directions#::
Whether edges have to exist in both directions between all members of a triangle.
+
If the direction of the edges is not important, set this to `false`. This will allow placing two
vertices into the same clique even if they are only connected in one direction.
