### Train KMeans clustering model

Trains a KMeans clustering model using the graph's vertex attributes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering[KMeans clustering] aims
to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs
to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
====
[[name]] Model name::
The model will be stored as a scalar attribute using this name.

[[features]] Feature attributes::
Attributes to be used as inputs for the training algorithm. The trained model
will have a list of features with the same names and semantics.

[[k]] K clusters::
The number of clusters to be created.

[[max-iter]] Maximum iterations::
The maximum number of iterations (>=0).

[[tolerance]] Tolerance::
The convergence tolerance for iterative algorithm.

[[seed]] Seed::
The random seed.
