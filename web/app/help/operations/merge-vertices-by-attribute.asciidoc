## Merge vertices by attribute

Merges each set of vertices that are equal by the chosen attribute. Aggregations
can be specified for how to handle the rest of the attributes, which may be different
among the merged vertices.

Note that any edge that connected two vertices merged will become a loop.

Example: You may want to merge phone numbers that have the same IMEI; each vertex will then
represent one person (assuming that an IMEI identifies a person).

It's a good idea to aggregate one attribute as "count" to have an attribute that represents the
number of vertices merged into one.

If a set of vertices have the same value for the selected attribute, they will all be merged
into a single vertex.
