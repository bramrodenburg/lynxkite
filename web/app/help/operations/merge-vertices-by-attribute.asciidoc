## Merge vertices by attribute

Merges each set of vertices that are equal by the chosen attribute. Aggregations
can be specified for how to handle the rest of the attributes, which may be different
among the merged vertices.

====

If a set of vertices have the same value for the selected attribute, they will all be merged
into a single vertex.
