### Import vertices and edges from single table

Imports edges from a table. Each line in the table represents one edge.
Each column in the table will be accessible as an edge attribute.

Vertices will be generated for the endpoints of the edges with two vertex attributes:

 - `stringID` will contain the ID string that was used in the table.
 - `id` will contain the internal vertex ID.

This is useful when your table contains edges (e.g., calls) and there is no separate
table for vertices. This operation makes it possible to load edges and use them
as a graph. Note that this graph will never have zero-degree vertices.
