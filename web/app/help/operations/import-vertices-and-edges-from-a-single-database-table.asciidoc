## Import vertices and edges from single database table

Imports edges from a SQL database. Each row in the table represents one edge.
Each column in the table will be accessible as an edge attribute.

Vertices will be generated for the endpoints of the edges with two vertex attributes:

 - `stringID` will contain the ID string that was used in the CSV.
 - `id` will contain the internal vertex ID.
