### Convert vertices into edges

Re-interprets the vertices as edges. You select two String-typed vertex attributes
which specify the source and destination of the edges. New vertices will be generated for each
distinct value of these attributes, and they will be connected if an original vertex described
a connection between them.

An example use-case is if your vertices are telephone calls. The converted graph will have
subscribers as its vertices and the calls as its edges.

====
[[src]] Source::
An A{to}B edge is generated if a vertex exists with the source attribute A and
destination attribute B.

[[dst]] Destination::
An A{to}B edge is generated if a vertex exists with the source attribute A and
destination attribute B.
