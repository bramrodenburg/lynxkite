## Create edges from set overlaps

Connects segments with large enough overlaps.

Communities are normally generated just as a set of points. But you
may be interested in looking for some structure there, seeing which
communities are connected to others. So you can generate edges between
them by looking at how many parent vertices they have in common.

[[minoverlap]] Minimal overlap for connecting two segments::
Two segments will be connected if they have at least this many members in common.
