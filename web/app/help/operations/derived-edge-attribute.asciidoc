### Derived edge attribute

Generates a new attribute based on existing attributes. The value expression can be
an arbitrary JavaScript expression, and it can refer to existing attributes on the edge as if
they were local variables. It can also refer to attributes of the source and destination
vertex of the edge using the format `src$attribute` and `dst$attribute`.



For example you can write `weight * Math.abs(src$age - dst$age)` to generate a new
attribute that is the weighted age difference of the two endpoints of the edge.
For more details see <<javascript-guide>>.

You can also refer to graph attributes (aka scalars) in the JS expression. For example,
assuming that you have a graph attribute _age_average_, you can use the expression
`src$age < age_average/2 && dst$age > age_average*2 ? 1.0 : 0.0`
to identify connections between relatively young and relatively old people.

====
[[output]] Save as::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[[type]] Result type::
The type (`Double` or `String`) of the created attribute.

[[defined-attrs]] Only run on defined attributes::
- If true the new attribute will only be defined on edges for which all the attributes used in the
  expression are defined.
- If false the new attribute is defined on all edges. In this case the JavaScript expression needs
  to be prepared to handle undefined input attribute values.

[[expr]] Value::
The JavaScript expression. You can enter multiple lines in the editor.
