## Derived edge attribute

Generates a new attribute based on existing attributes. The value expression can be
an arbitrary JavaScript expression, and it can refer to existing attributes on the edge as if
they were local variables. It can also refer to attributes of the source and destination
vertex of the edge using the format `src$attribute` and `dst$attribute`.

The new attribute will only be defined on edges for which all the attributes used in the
expression are defined.

For example you can write `weight * Math.abs(src$age - dst$age)` to generate a new
attribute that is the weighted age difference of the two endpoints of the edge.
