### Reduce vertex attributes to two dimensions 

Scale the mean and standard deviation of the data and reduce multiple double attributes to two double 
attributes by Principal Component Analysis.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to emphsize variation and bring out strong patterns in 
a dataset. It often makes data easy to explore and visualize.
