### Approximate Embeddedness

Scalable algorithm to calculate the approximate overlap size of vertex neighborhoods
along the edges. If an A{to}B edge has an embeddedness of `N`, it means A and B have
`N` common neighbors. The approximate embeddedness is undefined for loop edges.

[[bits]] The precision of the algorithm::
This algorithm is an approximation. This parameter sets the trade-off between
the quality of the approximation and the memory and time consumption of the algorithm.
