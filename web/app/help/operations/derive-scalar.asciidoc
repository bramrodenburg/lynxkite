### Derive scalar

Generates a new scalar (<<graph attribute, graph-attributes>>) based on existing scalars.
The value expression can be an arbitrary JavaScript expression, and it can refer to existing
scalars as if they were local variables.

For example you could derive a new scalar as `something_sum / something_count` to get the average
of something.
