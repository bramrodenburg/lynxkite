### Fingerprinting between project and segmentation

Finds the best matching between a project and a segmentation.
It considers a base vertex A and a segment B a good "match"
if the neighborhood of A (including A) is very connected to the neighborhood of B (including B)
according to the current connections between project and segmentation.

The result of this operation is a new edge set between the project and the
segmentation, that is a one-to-one matching.

====
The matches are identified by calculating a similarity score between vertices and picking a
matching that ensures a high total similarity score across the matched pairs.

The similarity calculation is based on the network structure: the more alike their neighborhoods
are, the more similar two vertices are considered. Vertex attributes are not considered in the
calculation.

*Example use case*

Project M is an MSISDN graph based on call data. Project F is a Facebook
graph. A CSV file contains a number of MSISDN{to}Facebook ID mappings, a many-to-many
relationship. Connect the two projects with <<import-project-as-segmentation>> and
<<load-segmentation-links-from-csv>>, then use the
fingerprinting operation to turn the mapping into a high-quality one-to-one relationship.

*Parameters*

[[mo]] Minimum overlap::
The number of common neighbors two vertices must have to be considered for matching.
It must be at least 1. (If two vertices have no common neighbors their similarity would be zero
anyway.)

[[ms]] Minimum similarity::
The similarity threshold below which two vertices will not be considered a match even if there are
no better matches for them. Similarity is normalized to [0, 1].

[[extra]] Fingerprinting algorithm additional parameters::
You can use this box to further tweak how the fingerprinting operation works. Consult with a Lynx
expert if you think you need this.
