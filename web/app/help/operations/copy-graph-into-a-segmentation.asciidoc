### Copy graph into a segmentation

Imports the project as its own segmentation and creates edges between the original
vertices and their corresponding vertices in the segmentation.

For example, to find the <<PageRank>> of nodes by ignoring edges with certain properties you
can do a filter and a <<PageRank>> on the imported segmentation and then copy back
the resulting attribute.
