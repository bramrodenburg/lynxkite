### Centrality

Calculates an approximation of the centrality for every vertex. Higher centrality means that
the vertex is more embedded in the graph.

[[name]] Attribute name::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[[maxdiameter]] Maximal diameter to check::
The algorithm works by counting the shortest paths up to a certain length in each iteration.
This parameter sets the maximal length to check, so it has a strong influence over the run
time of the operation.

A setting lower than the actual diameter of the graph can theoretically introduce unbounded error
to the results. In typical small world graphs this effect may be acceptable, however.

[[algorithm]] The centrality algorithm to use::
- The Harmonic Centrality of the vertex A is the sum of the reciprocals of all shortest paths to A.
- Lin's Centrality of the vertex A is the square of the size of it's coreachable set divided by the
sum of the shortest paths to A.
