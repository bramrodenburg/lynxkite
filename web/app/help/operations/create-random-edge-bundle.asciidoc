## Create random edge bundle

Creates edges randomly, so that each vertex will have a degree uniformly chosen between 0 and
2 &times; the provided parameter.

====
[[degree]] Average degree::
The degree of a vertex will be chosen uniformly between 0 and 2 &times; this number.
This results in generating _number of vertices &times; average degree_ edges.

[[seed]] Seed::
The random seed.
