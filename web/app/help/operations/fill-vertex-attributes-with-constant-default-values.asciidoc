An attribute may not be defined on every vertex. This operation sets a default value
for the vertices where it was not defined.

====
[[title]] Attributes::

[[title2]]  Default values::
The value to set for vertices where the attribute is not defined. No change for
attributes for which the default value is left empty. The default value
must be numeric for `Double` attributes.
