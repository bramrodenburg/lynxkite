## Add constant edge attribute

Adds an attribute with a fixed value to every edge.

Example usage: Create a constant edge attribute with value 'A' to the graph in project A.
Then, create a constant edge attribute with value 'B' to the graph in project B. Use the same
attribute name in both cases. From then on, if a union graph is created from these two graphs,
the edge attribute will tell which graph the edge originally belonged to.
