### Use table as edges

Imports edges from a table. Your vertices must have an identifying attribute, by which
the edges can be attached to them.

====
*Example use case*

If you have one table for the vertices (e.g. subscribers) and another
for the edges (e.g., calls), you import the first table with the <<Use table as vertices>>
operation and then use this operation to add the edges.

*Parameters*

include::{g}[tag=table-import]

[[attr]] Vertex ID attribute::
The IDs that are used in the file when defining the edges.

[[src]] Source ID column::
The table column that specifies the source of the edge.

[[dst]] Destination ID column::
The table column that specifies the destination of the edge.
