### Input

This special box represents an input that comes from outside of this workspace.
This box will not have a valid output on its own. When this workspace is used as a custom
box in another workspace, the custom box will have one input for each input box.
When the inputs are connected, those input states will appear on the outputs of the input boxes.

Input boxes without a name are ignored. Each input box must have a different name.
