### Project rejoin

This operation allows the user to join (i.e., carry over) attributes from on project to another one.
This is only allowed when the target of the join (where the attributes are taken to) and the source
(where the attributes are taken from) are compatible. Compatibility in this context means that
the source and the target have a "common ancestor", which makes it possible to perform the join.
Suppose, for example, that operation <<take-edges-as-vertices>> have been applied, and then some
new vertex attributes have been computed on the resulting project. These new vertex
attributes can now be joined back to the original project (that was the input for
<<take-edges-as-vertices>>), because there is a correspondence between the edges of the
original project and the vertices that contain the newly computed vertex attributes.

Conversely, the edges and the vertices of a project will not be compatible (even
if the number of edges is the same as the number of vertices), because no such
correspondence can be established between the edges and the vertices in this case.

Additionally, it is possible to join segmentations from another project. This operation
has an additional requirement (besides compatibility), namely, that both the target of the
join (the left side) and the source be vertices (and not edges).

Please, bear it in mind that both attributes and segmentations will overwrite
the original attributes and segmentations on the right side in case there is
a name collision.

When vertex attributes are joined, it is also possible to copy over the edges from
the source graph (provided that the source graph has edges). In this case, the
original edges in the target graph are dropped, and the source edges (along with
their attributes) will take their place.

====
[p-attrs]#Attributes#::
Attributes that should be joined to the project. They overwrite attributes in the
target project which have identical names.

[p-segs]#Segmentations#::
Segmentations to join to the project. They overwrite segmentations in the target
side of the project which have identical names.

[p-edge]#Copy edges#::
When set, the edges of the source project (and their attributes) will replace
the edges of the target project.
