### Predict edges with hyperbolic positions

Creates additional edges in a graph based on
hyperbolic distances between vertices. 
 _2 * size_ edges will be added because 
the new edges are undirected.
Vertices must have two _Double_ vertex attributes to be 
used as radial and angular coordinates.

====
[[size]] Number of predictions::
The number of edges to generate.
The total number will be _2 * size_ because every
edge is added in two directions.

[[externaldegree]] External degree::
The number of edges a vertex creates from itself
 upon addition to the growth simulation graph.

[[internaldegree]] Internal degree::
The average number of edges created between older vertices whenever 
a new vertex is added to the growth simulation graph.

[[exponent]] Exponent::
The exponent of the power-law degree distribution. 
Values can be 0.5 - 1, endpoints excluded.

[[radial]] Radial::
The vertex attribute to be used as radial coordinates.
Should not contain negative values.

[[angular]] Angular::
The vertex attribute to be used as angular coordinates.
Values should be 0 - 2 * Pi.
