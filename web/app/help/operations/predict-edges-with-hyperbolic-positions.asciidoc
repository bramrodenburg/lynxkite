### Predict edges with hyperbolic positions

Creates additional edges in a graph based on
hyperbolic distances between vertices. 
Creates probability x similarity optimized edges in addition
to already existing ones. The number of new edges will be 
slightly less than _2 * size_; added edges are undirected.
Vertices must have vertex attributes "radial" and "angular".

====
[[size]] Number of predictions::
The number of predicted to generate. Actual number will be 
slightly less because .distinct is applied to the edges.

[[exponent]] Exponent::
The exponent of the power-law degree distribution. 
Values can be 0.5 - 1, endpoints excluded.
