### Modular clustering

Tries to find a partitioning of the vertices with high
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)[modularity].

Edges that go between vertices in the same segment increase modularity, while edges that go from
one segment to the other decrease modularity. The algorithm iteratively merges and splits segments
until it cannot find changes that would significantly improve the modularity score.

====
[[name]] Segmentation name::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[[weights]] Weight attribute::
The attribute to use as edge weights.
