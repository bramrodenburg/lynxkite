### Import CSV

CSV stands for comma-separated values. It is a common human-readable file format where each record
is on a separate line and fields of the record are simply separated with a comma or other delimiter.
CSV does not store data types, so all fields become strings when importing from this format.

====
[[last_settings]] The settings are ..::
Operations which import data from external source are executed only when the _Run import_ button
is clicked. This field is a reminder for the user to easily see if the settings are in sync with
the output of the box.

[[filename]] File::
Upload a file by clicking the
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud-upload"></i></label>+++ button
or specify a path explicitly. Wildcard (`+foo/*.csv+`) and glob (`+foo/{bar,baz}.csv+`) patterns are
accepted. See <<prefixed-paths>> for more details on specifying paths.

[[columns]] Columns in file::
The names of all the columns in the file, as a comma-separated list. If empty, the column names will
be read from the file. (Use this if the file has a header.)

[[delimiter]] Delimiter::
The delimiter separating the fields in each line.

[[error_handling]] Error handling::
What should happen if a line has more or less fields than the number of columns?
+
**Fail on any malformed line** will cause the import to fail if there is such a line.
+
**Ignore malformed lines** will simply omit such lines from the table. In this case an erroneously
defined column list can result in an empty table.
+
**Salvage malformed lines: truncate or fill with nulls** will still import the problematic lines,
dropping some data or inserting undefined values.

[[infer]] Infer types::
Automatically detects data types in the CSV. For example a column full of numbers will become a
`Double`. If disabled, all columns are imported as ``String``s.
