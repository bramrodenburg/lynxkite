### Import CSV

CSV stands for comma-separated values. It is a common human-readable file format where each record
is on a separate line and fields of the record are simply separated with a comma or other delimiter.
CSV does not store data types, so all fields become strings when importing from this format.

====
[[filename]] File::
Upload a file by clicking the
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud-upload"></i></label>+++ button
or specify a path explicitly. Wildcard (`+foo/*.csv+`) and glob (`+foo/{bar,baz}.csv+`) patterns are
accepted. See <<prefixed-paths>> for more details on specifying paths.

[[columns]] Columns in file::
The names of all the columns in the file, as a comma-separated list. If empty, the column names will
be read from the file. (Use this if the file has a header.)

[[delimiter]] Delimiter::
The delimiter separating the fields in each line.

[[quote]] Quote character::
The character used for escaping quoted values where the delimiter can be part of the value.

[[escape]] Escape character::
The character used for escaping quotes inside an already quoted value.

[[null_value]] Null value::
The string representation of a `null` value in the CSV file. For example if set to `undefined`,
every `undefined` value in the CSV file will be converted to Scala `null`-s.
By default this is an empty string, so empty strings are converted to `null`-s upon import.

[[date_format]] Date format::
The string that indicates a date format. Custom date formats follow the formats at
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[java.text.SimpleDateFormat].

[[timestamp_format]] Timestamp format::
The string that indicates a timestamp format. Custom date formats follow the formats at
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[java.text.SimpleDateFormat].

[[ignore_leading_white_space]] Ignore leading white space::
A flag indicating whether or not leading whitespaces from values being read should be skipped.

[[ignore_trailing_white_space]] Ignore trailing white space::
A flag indicating whether or not trailing whitespaces from values being read should be skipped.

[[comment]] Comment character::
Every line beginning with this character is skipped, if set. For example if the comment character is
`#` the following line is ignored in the CSF file: `# This is a comment.`

[[error_handling]] Error handling::
What should happen if a line has more or less fields than the number of columns?
+
**Fail on any malformed line** will cause the import to fail if there is such a line.
+
**Ignore malformed lines** will simply omit such lines from the table. In this case an erroneously
defined column list can result in an empty table.
+
**Salvage malformed lines: truncate or fill with nulls** will still import the problematic lines,
dropping some data or inserting undefined values.

[[infer]] Infer types::
Automatically detects data types in the CSV. For example a column full of numbers will become a
`Double`. If disabled, all columns are imported as ``String``s.
