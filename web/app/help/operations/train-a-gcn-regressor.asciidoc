### Train a GCN regressor

Trains a Graph Convolutional Network using https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Pytorch Geometric].
Applicable for regression problems.

====
[p-save_as]#Save model as#::
The resulting model will be saved as a Scalar using this name.

[p-iterations]#Iterations#::
Number of training iterations.

[p-features]#Feature vector#::
Vector attribute containing the features to be used as inputs for the training algorithm.

[p-label]#Attribute to predict#::
The attribute we want to predict.

[p-forget]#Use labels as inputs#::
Set true to use the labels as input. In that case, outside of the current batch the label
behaves as an input feature.

[p-batch_size]#Batch size#::
Size of the training batches.

[p-learning_rate]#Learning rate#::
Value of the learning rate.

[p-hidden_size]#Hidden size#::
Size of the hidden layers.

[p-num_conv_layers]#Number of convolution layers#::
Number of convolution layers.

[p-conv_op]#Convolution operator#::
The type of graph convolution to use.
