### Connect vertices on attribute

Creates edges between vertices that are equal in a chosen attribute. If the source attribute of A
equals the destination attribute of B, an A{to}B edge will be generated.

The two attributes must be of the same data type.

For example, if you connect nodes based on the "name" attribute, then everyone called "John 
Smith" will be connected to all the other "John Smiths".

====
[[fromattr]] Source attribute::
An A{to}B edge is generated when this attribute on A matches the destination attribute on B.

[[toattr]] Destination attribute::
An A{to}B edge is generated when the source attribute on A matches this attribute on B.
