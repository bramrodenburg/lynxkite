### segment by interval

Segments the vertices by a pair of `double` vertex attributes representing intervals.

The domain of the attributes is split into intervals of the given size. Each of these
intervals will represent a segment. Each vertex will belong to each segment whose
interval intersects with the interval of the vertex. Empty segments are not created.

====
[[name]] segmentation name::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[[begin_attr]] Begin attribute::
The `double` attribute corresponding the beginning of intervals to segment by.

[[end_attr]] End attribute::
The `double` attribute corresponding the end of intervals to segment by.

[[interval_size]] interval size::
The attribute's domain will be split into intervals of this size. The splitting always starts at
zero.

[[overlap]] overlap::
If you enable overlapping intervals, then each interval will have a 50% overlap
with both the previous and the next interval.
