### Grow segmentation

Grows the segmentation along edges of the parent graph.

This operation creates a new segmentation on the parent graph using the segments of this
segmentation by adding the neighbors of the elements of each segment. For
example if vertex A is a member of segment X and edge A{to}B exists in the original graph
then B also becomes the member of X (depending on the value of the direction parameter).

This operation can be used together with "Copy graph into a segmentation" to create a segmentation
of neighborhoods.
