### Copy scalar from other project

This operation can take a scalar from an other project and copy it
to the current project.

It can be useful if we trained a machine learning model in one project, and would like
to apply this model in another project for predicting undefined attribute values.

====
[p-sourceproject]#Other project's name#::
The name of the other project from where we want to copy a scalar.

[p-sourcescalarname]#Name of the scalar in the other project#::
The name of the scalar in the other project. If it is a simple string, then
the scalar with that name has to be in the root of the other project. If it is
a `.`-separated string, then it means a scalar in a segmentation of the other project.
The syntax for this case is: `seg_1.seg_2.....seg_n.scalar`.

[p-destscalarname]#Name for the scalar in this project#::
This will be the name of the copied scalar in this project.
