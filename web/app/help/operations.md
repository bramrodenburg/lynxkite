# Operations

## Discard vertices

Throws away all vertices. This implies discarding all edges, attributes, and segmentations too.

## Discard edges

Throws away all edges. This implies discarding all edge attributes too.

## New vertex set

Creates a new vertex set with no edges. Two attributes are generated, `id` and `ordinal`. `id`
is the internal vertex ID, while `ordinal` is an index for the vertex: it goes from zero to the
vertex set size.
