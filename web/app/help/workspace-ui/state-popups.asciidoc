## State popups

Click on an output of a box to open that output state in a popup.
Click the output again, or click on the +++<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></i>+++ in the top
right corner to close the popup. You can also press ESC to close the last used popup.

Different output types have different data and features available in their popups.
But some things they all have in common.


### Snapshots

The toolbar at the top of the state popup always contains a
+++<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-camera"></i>+++ icon, for saving the state as a _snapshot_. The
snapshot will be saved outside of the workspace, in the directory tree. Snapshots are independent of
the workspaces from which they were saved. Use them to share final results, or record intermediate
results for comparison.

Snapshots can be loaded back into a project with a <<Import snapshot>> box.


### Instruments

Boxes like <<Graph visualization>>, <<SQL1>>, <<Custom plot>> are essential for looking at your
data. It is very natural to want to take a quick look at the data in the middle of a complex
workspace.

One option is to quickly create and attach a <<Graph visualization>> box, see what the
graph looks like at that point, then delete the box.
Instruments are effectively the same, except no temporary box is added to the workspace. This means
instruments can be used even on read-only workspaces.

The instrument buttons are in the popup toolbar. For example, in the last screenshot the buttons for
**SQL** and **Visualize** are visible, corresponding to the <<SQL1>> and <<Graph visualization>>
boxes. If you click on **SQL**, the popup contents are replaced by the _box
parameters_ of the <<SQL1>> box at the top and the _output state_ of the <<SQL1>> box
at the bottom.

The output state of the instrument once again has a toolbar for snapshotting and applying
instruments. This makes it possible to apply one instrument after the other:

Instruments are not saved into the workspace. But they are built from regular boxes, so the same
calculations can always be reproduced using conventional boxes.


### Project state

A "project" is a rich type that represents graphs and their segmentations in one bundle. The popup
for a project output makes it possible to see basic information about the graph, such as the number
of vertices and edges, and the list of scalars, attributes, and segmentations. Scalar values are
displayed, attribute histograms are available on click, and segmentations can be opened to dig
deeper.


### Table state

Tables are the same in LynxKite as in relational databases and spreadsheet programs: they are a
matrix of columns and rows. Tables are the input and output of SQL queries. Projects can be built
from tables via <<Use table as vertices>>, <<Use table as edges>>, and similar operations.


### Plot state

The plot state is a data visualization created via the <<Custom plot>> box, or one of the built-in
plotting boxes.


### Export state

Export boxes, such as <<Export to CSV>>, allow you to configure an export operation. The output of
these boxes is an export state. It is the export state which actually allows triggering the often
resource-intensive computation of creating the output files.

This two-step process avoids accidental exports while editing the workspace. It also provides
metadata information about the output file, such as its path. To trigger the export, click on the
+++<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i>+++ icon.
