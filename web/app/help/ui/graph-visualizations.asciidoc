## Graph visualizations

When some kind of visualization is turned on a visualization screen opens above the
<<project-header>>.

There are multiple types of visualizations, but in every case you see some objects connected by
some arcs.

Visualized objects can represent vertices or groups of vertices of the graph.
The same way arcs on the screen might represent multiple edges in the graph.
E.g. if there are multiple parallel edges A{to}B it will still be represented by a single visualized
arc. Also, when we display groups of vertices then a single arc going from one group to another
represents all the edges in the graph going from one group to the other.

You can visualize graph attributes in various ways, see details in section
<<attribute-visualizations>>.

Regardless of the visualization mode you can do the same basic adjustments on the visualization
screen:

Zooming in/out::
Use your mouse wheel or scroll gesture to zoom in and out. Left doubleclick and right
doubleclick can also be used for this.

Panning::
Hold down your left mouse button anywhere on the visualizaton screen and drag the graph around.

Zooming objects in/out::
Hold down the Shift button while zooming in and out to only change the size of objects
(vertices, edges).


### Concrete vertices view

Shows some selected [[center-vertices]]center vertices and their neighborhood with all the edges
 among these vertices. The set of the center vertices and the size of the neighborhood can be
 selected by the user.

When this mode is selected the user is presented with a set of extra controls below the
<<project-header>>:

[[concrete-view-settings]]
Display::
You can select between 2D and 3D visualization. 3D allows for showing more vertices efficiently but
that mode has less features. You cannot (yet) visualize attributes in 3D mode and cannot select and
move around vertices.

Layout animation::
(Only in 2D mode) If enabled, layout animation will continuously do a physical simulation on the
displayed graph as if edges were springs. You can move vertices around and the graph will
reorganize itself.

Label attraction::
When animation is enabled, this will make vertices with the same label attract each other, which
results in same label vertices being grouped together.

Layout style::
When animation is enabled, this option determines the exact physics of the simulation.
The different options can be useful depending on the structure of the network that is visualized.
+
The available options are:
+
Centralize::: High-degree nodes in the center, low-degree nodes on the periphery.
Decentralize::: Low-degree nodes in the center, high-degree nodes on the periphery.
Neutral::: Degree is not factored into the layout.

Show vertices::
Lists ‘center’ vertices, that is the vertices whose neighborhood we are displaying. You can change
this list manually, using the <<pick-button,Pick button>> or using the
<<context-menu,context menu>> of already displayed vertices. Setting an asterisk here will
result in the visualization of all the vertices (up to a certain limit).

Show neighborhood::
You can set the neighborhood radius from 0 to 10. 0 means center vertices only. 1 means center
vertices and their immediate neighbors. 2 also contains neighbors of neighbors. And so on.

#### Pick button
You can use the pick button to select the <<center-vertices,center vertices>> for the visualization.
Which vertex will be chosen as the center will depend on the contents of the Show vertices box.
By default, only one vertex is offered. You can change this behavior by setting the Center count
field of the advanced Pick options menu. The list of vertices offered will be limited by the
currently set filters; these can be removed and new filters added with the Add Restriction button.


#### Context menu
When clicking a vertex in Concrete Vertex View you can see a context menu with possible operations
related to the vertex. Here are the possible menu elements:

Add to centers::
This action will add the selected vertex to the centers.

Set as only center::
This action will set this vertex as the only center so that only this vertex and its neigborhood
will be shown.

Filter segmentation to this vertex::
It will setup a filter on the segmentation
graph such that only segments that contain this vertex are selected. This menu is only available if
a segmentation is open on the right side.

Freeze/unfreeze::
If using layout animation, freeze fixes the position of this particular vertex. Unfreeze lets
the vertex move free again.

### Bucketed view

Shows a consolidated view of all the vertices of the graph. Vertices can be grouped by up to two
attributes and the system visualizes the sizes of the groups and the amount of edges going among
the groups.

### Saving visualizations

You can save your current visualization settings using the `Save Visualization` button (only visible when visualization is enabled). Just type a name, press `Save Visualization` again and a new
entry with the name you've given will show up in the `Attributes of the graph` section.

You can reload the saved visualization options by pressing on the
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></i></label>+++
 button next to the newly created graph attribute.
