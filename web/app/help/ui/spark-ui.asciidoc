## Spark UI

The Spark UI elements are in the right bottom corner of the browser.

The rotating gear indicates that Spark is calculating something.

The 'Stop calculation' button sends an interruption signal to Spark.
Note that it's not possible to interrupt the processing of a certain unit
of work. What the button does is abort all the outstanding units. So once
the units that are already being worked on complete, the calculation will
come to a halt. Also note that the button cancels all out outstanding
units, not just the ones initiated by the user pressing the button.

The little colorful rectangles correspond to the the previously mentioned
units of work. The height of the rectangle indicates the completeness of the
unit, the color corresponds to the type of work it does.
