# SQL syntax

SQL is a rich language for expressing database queries. A simple example of such a query is:

    select last_age + (2018 - last_update_year) as age_in_2018 from input

For a concise description of the query syntax see
https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/select.html[Databrick's documentation for `SELECT` queries].

SQL also comes with a variety of built-in functions. See the
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/[list of built-in functions] in the Apache Spark SQL
documentation.

LynxKite adds the following built-in functions:

`geodistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)`::
Computes the geographic distance between two points defined by their GPS coordinates.

`hash(string, salt)`::
Computes a cryptographic hash of `string`. See <<Hash vertex attribute>>

`most_common(column)`::
Returns the most common value for a string column.

`string_intersect(set1, set2)`::
For two sets of strings (as returned by `collect_set()`) returns the common subset.
