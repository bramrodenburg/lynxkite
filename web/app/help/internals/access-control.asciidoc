## User authentication & access control

User authentication is an optional feature and can be turned on or off depending on the
deployment. If user authentication is enabled LynxKite data can only be accessed after
authentication. The _logout_ link is only displayed at the bottom right if authentication
is enabled.

### Access control lists

Access rights are controlled at the project and the folder level. A project or a folder
has two access control lists: one for reading and one for writing.

- The users on the reading list of a folder can list the contents of the folder.
- The users on the writing list of a folder can create, delete and rename projects and
subfolders. Note that renaming requires write access on both the original and the new
folder if those two are different. Similarly, copying (duplicating) a project or a folder
requires write access on the target folder.
- The users on the reading list of a project can see everything in the project but
cannot make changes.
- The users on the writing list of a project can see everything and make any change
(including modifying the writing list).

The access control lists can be modified in the project or folder settings
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></i></label>+++.
The lists are comma-delimited and `+*+` (asterisk) can be used as a wildcard. `+*+`
means all logged in users. `+*@lynxanalytics.com+`, for example, means all users with
user names matching that pattern.

When creating a project or a folder, you have the choice of setting it to _private_,
_publicly readable_ or _publicly writable_. These options provide different default
access control lists, but the lists can be freely modified later.

If a user has no read access to a project or a folder, they will not show up for them
in the project list.

If a user has read-only access to a project, they can always create a copy of the project
and make changes to the copy.

### Administrator users

Administrator users have special privileges:

- Administrators can read and write all projects and folders, regardless of the access
control lists. They can also change these access control lists.
- Administrators can create new users, including new administrators. The users are
managed through the `/users` page.

### Home folder

A home folder is created for every user automatically. This folder has read and
write access only by that user by default. The home folder is ideal to protect your
projects from other (non admin) users. Remember, deleting a project requires write access
on it's parent folder.
