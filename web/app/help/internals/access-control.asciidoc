## User authentication & access control

User authentication is an optional feature and can be turned on or off depending on the
deployment. If user authentication is enabled LynxKite data can only be accessed after
authentication. The _logout_ link is only displayed at the bottom right if authentication
is enabled.

### Access control lists

Access rights are controlled at three levels: the project level, the folder level,
and the file prefix level. The latter is only relevant to administrators
and described in the Admin Manual; the first two are described below.

A project or a folder has two access control lists: one for reading
and one for writing. A user has read
access to a project or a folder if he is on it's access control list and has read
access to the parent folders recursively. Similarly, write access requires being on the
write access control list plus _read_ access for all parents. Being on the write access
control list implies being on the read access list on every local level.

- The users with read access to a folder can view it's contents.
- The users with write access to a folder can create, delete and rename projects and
subfolders. Note that renaming requires write access on both the original and the
target folder if those two are different. Similarly, copying (duplicating) a project or
a folder requires write access to the target folder.
- The users with read access to a project can see everything in the project but
cannot make changes.
- The users with write access to a project can see everything and make any change
(including modifying the writing list).

The access control lists can be modified in the project or folder settings
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></i></label>+++.
The lists are comma-delimited and `+*+` (asterisk) can be used as a wildcard. `+*+`
means all logged in users. `+*@lynxanalytics.com+`, for example, means all users with
user names matching that pattern.

When creating a project or a folder, you have the choice of setting it to _private_,
_publicly readable_ or _publicly writable_. These options provide different default
access control lists, but the lists can be freely modified later.

If a user has no read access to a project or a folder, they will not show up for them
in the project list.

If a user has read-only access to a project, they can always create a copy of the
project and make changes to the copy.

To protect your projects from other users you have to put it in a folder writable only
by you. Remember, deleting a project requires write access to it's parent folder, not
the project itself.

### Administrator users

Administrator users have special privileges:

- Administrators can read and write all projects and folders, regardless of the access
control lists. They can also change these access control lists.
- Administrators can create new users, including new administrators. The users are
managed through the `/users` page.

### Home folder

A home folder is created for every user automatically. This folder has read and
write access only by that user by default.
