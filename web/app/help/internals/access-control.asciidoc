## User authentication & access control

User authentication is an optional feature and can be turned on or off depending on the
deployment. If user authentication is enabled LynxKite data can only be accessed after
authentication. The _logout_ link is only displayed at the bottom right if authentication
is enabled.

### Access control lists

Access rights are controlled at the project level. A project has two access control lists, one
for reading and one for writing.

- The users on the reading list can see everything in the project but cannot make changes.
- The users on the writing list can see everything and make any change (including modifying
the writing list).

The access control lists can be modified in the project settings
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></i></label>+++.
The lists are comma-delimited and `+*+` (asterisk) can be used as a wildcard. `+*+` means all
logged in users. `+*@lynxanalytics.com+`, for example, means all users with user names matching
that pattern.

When creating a project, you have the choice of setting it to _private_, _publicly readable_, or
_publicly writable_. These options provide different default access control lists, but the lists
can be freely modified later.

If a user has no read access to a project, that project will not show up for them in the project
list.

If a user has read-only access to a project, they can always create a copy of the project and
make changes to the copy.

### Administrator users

Administrator users have special privileges:

- Administrators can read and write all projects, regardless of the access control lists.
- Administrators can create new users, including new administrators. The users are managed
through the `/users` page.
