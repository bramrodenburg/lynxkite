 - Select all vertices (up to 10,000) as center by setting `*` (star) as the center.
 - 3D graph visualization in concrete vertices view.

### 1.0.0

 - Adds label size as a new visualization option.
 - UI for selecting vertex attribute visualizations has changed as a preparation for adding more
   visualization options.
 - Export `Vector` type attributes as a semicolon-separated list.
 - Vertex ID is no longer displayed in the visualization by default.
   It is still accessible by setting the ID attribute as the label.
 - User management page at `/#/users`.

   Compatibility with future versions, however, is guaranteed.
