# This file contains various configurations used when launching LynxKite on Amazon Elastic
# MapReduce (EMR).

# Specify the name of the cluster.
CLUSTER_NAME=${USER}-cluster

# Set the number of worker instances in the cluster.
NUM_INSTANCES=3

# Specify the type of the instance to create.
TYPE=m3.2xlarge

# Specify the id of the SSH key that you want to use to connect to the cluster.
SSH_ID=lynx-cli

# Specify the private key file for the ID above.
SSH_KEY=${HOME}/.ssh/lynx-cli.pem

# Specify in which region the cluster should run.
REGION=us-east-1

# The configurations below are determined by the instance type above, however it is still required
# to fill them. See the EMR
# task configuration (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/TaskConfiguration_H2.html)
# documentation for memory limits and the EC2 instance types (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
# documentation for number of cores.
CORES=8
# YARN limit minus overhead minus 1GB so that the application master fits on one machine.
USE_RAM_GB=18

# The local temp directory is a local path that exists on all workers and the master and will
# be used for storing temporary Spark/Hadoop files. This directory can potentially use a lot of
# space, so if you have a small root filesystem and an extra large drive mounted somewhere then you
# need to point this to somewhere on the large drive. On the other hand performance of this drive has
# a significant effect on overall speed, so using an SSD is a nice option here.
LOCAL_TMP_DIR=/mnt/tmp

# Find some working example configurations below:
# TYPE=m1.large
# CORES=2
# USE_RAM_GB=3
# LOCAL_TMP_DIR=/mnt/tmp

# TYPE=m3.2xlarge
# CORES=8
# USE_RAM_GB=19
# LOCAL_TMP_DIR=/mnt/tmp

# Specify the S3 directory to store graph data in without the s3:// prefix. It must use the
# same credentials as the user starting the cluster. Used as the backup location with the
# s3copy command. This needs to be in the same region as REGION. Or you get charged by Amazon.
